USE DATABASE tasty_bytes;

-- 1. Use the SHOW FUNCTIONS command. What is the value in the “description” column for the row associated with the “CURRENT_TIMESTAMP” function?
SHOW FUNCTIONS;

-- 2. Use the database TASTY_BYTES. Create a function called min_menu_price using the CREATE FUNCTION command. Have it return the data type NUMBER(5,2), and make the contents of the function the following: “SELECT MIN(SALE_PRICE_USD) FROM TASTY_BYTES.RAW_POS.MENU”. When you run “SELECT min_menu_price();” what is the column name and the value that you see in the Results?
CREATE FUNCTION min_menu_price()
RETURNS NUMBER(5, 2)
AS
$$
    SELECT MIN(SALE_PRICE_USD)
    FROM TASTY_BYTES.RAW_POS.MENU
$$;
SELECT min_menu_price();

-- 3. Run the SHOW FUNCTIONS command. What is the value in the “max_num_arguments” column associated with the “MIN_MENU_PRICE” row (the row that lists “MIN_MENU_PRICE” in the “name” column)?
SHOW FUNCTIONS;

-- 4. Use the database TASTY_BYTES. Create a user-defined table function called menu_prices_below using the CREATE FUNCTION command. Have it take in an argument called “price_ceiling” of type “NUMBER.” Have it return “TABLE (item VARCHAR, price NUMBER),”. When you run “SELECT * FROM TABLE(menu_prices_below(3));” what is the item you see repeated multiple times in Results?
CREATE FUNCTION menu_prices_below(price_ceiling NUMBER)
RETURNS TABLE (item VARCHAR, price NUMBER)
AS
$$
    SELECT
        MENU_ITEM_NAME,
        SALE_PRICE_USD
    FROM TASTY_BYTES.RAW_POS.MENU
    WHERE SALE_PRICE_USD < price_ceiling
    ORDER BY 2 DESC
$$;
SELECT *
FROM TABLE(menu_prices_below(3));

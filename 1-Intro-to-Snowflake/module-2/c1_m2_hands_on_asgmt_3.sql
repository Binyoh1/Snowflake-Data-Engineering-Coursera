-- 1. Create a resource monitor called “tasty_test_rm” with a credit_quota of 15, a daily frequency, a start_timestamp of immediately, and a trigger of “notify” on 90 percent. Then use the SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS command. What value is in the “notify_at” column for the “tasty_test_rm” monitor?

SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS;

After doing this, when you run SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS, what value do you see for “TASTY_TEST_RM” in the “level” column?
CREATE OR REPLACE WAREHOUSE tasty_test_wh;
ALTER WAREHOUSE tasty_test_wh 
SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = rm_tasty_test;
SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS;
